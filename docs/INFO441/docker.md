# Docker

#### Run a docker container

```
docker run hello-world
```
Just prints out hello world (good for testing if Docker is working)

```
docker ps
```
See what is running

Add “-a” to include stopped containers

```
docker rm CONTAINER_NAME
```
Remove a docker container

```
docker run -it ubuntu
```
Run the ubuntu Linux operating system

Note: “-it” means to run it as an interactive terminal 

```
docker run -p 80:80 nginx
```

nginx is a popular static web server

Note: by default, a container is closed to traffic on all ports.

- “-p 80:80” says: for traffic coming in on port 80, send it to port 80 inside the container

### Docker demo

```
FROM nginx
COPY . /usr/share/nginx/html
```

The “Dockerfile” is a definition for a docker container.

It consists of a set of steps, starting “FROM” a specific docker container, and then running additional steps (e.g., copying files) to set up the container the way you want it.
