# Testing

### NON-automated testing
- Click around and try things yourself!

- Manual testing (team): usually has a list of things to click through

- User (research) testing: give users your site and let them click around


### Automated Testing of Code
- Definition: Automated tests are additional code that tests the code of a project

	- This includes how things should go correctly AND incorrectly

- Types of Tests

	- Unit tests: test ONE thing

	- Integration Tests: isolate and test code that calls other code, for example, is this code connecting to the db?

	- System Tests/E2E Tests: test the overall system; E2E is the flow end-to-end, System is in the context of a prod-like environment

	- Stress Tests: test what happens when parts of the system fail

- Strategies:

	- Running Tests: Continuous Integration Testing

	- How do we know our tests are right?

		- Code Coverage

		- We don’t know (Skype/postmortems/rollbacks)
        
	- Best practices:

		- When something breaks in prod, the fix should include a test that would have caught that change/error

		- CI/CD testing: on PR, if something new is broken, block merge

`npm install --save-dev <package>`

- Installs the package as a **development dependency**.

- Adds it to the `"devDependencies"` section in `package.json`.

- Used when the package is **only needed during development** (e.g. for testing, building, or linting).

`npm test` run test in project
