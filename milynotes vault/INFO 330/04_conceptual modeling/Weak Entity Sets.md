- A **weak entity** can't be uniquely identified by its own attributes alone.
- It **depends** on a **strong entity** (another table/entity) for its **primary key**.
- From the example:
	**University(name)** → Strong entity (can be identified just by `name`).
	**Team(sport, number, universityName)** → Weak entity (needs `universityName` to uniquely identify a Team).
        
Without the university's name, you might have multiple teams with the same sport and number — but _which_ university they belong to would be unclear.


Why do we care about Weak Entities?
1. **Avoid Duplicating Keys**:
    - Instead of copying the whole key into every weak entity, you reference it simply.
2. **Reflect Logical Structure**:
    - It models real-world dependency — e.g., a Team exists only **because** a University exists.
3. **Automatic Deletion**:
    - If the **strong entity** (like a University) is deleted, the **dependent weak entities** (like its Teams) should automatically be deleted too.


### Weak Relationship

A relationship is weak (identifying) only if it connects a weak entity to its owner (strong entity) and is used to define its primary key.
