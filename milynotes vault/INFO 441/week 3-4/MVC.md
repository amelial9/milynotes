Model-View-Controller

A way of organizing full stack web application code
	Model: Database and data representation
	View: How the data is displayed
	Controller: Connecting the model to the view
		Letting the view perform actions on the data
			For example, CRUD actions (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
	In our code:
		Model: Database, database connection and data organization definitions
		View: The client code in the public directory (html, css, js)
		Controller: The route handlers, allowing the view to perform operations on the model


#### Model
Database, database connection and data organizaitn definitions

#### Controllers
The route handlers, allowing the view to perform operations on the model

#### View
The client code in the "public directory" (html, css, js)
