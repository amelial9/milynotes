## Transaction

Definition: a transaction is a sequence of updates to the database with the property that either all complete, or none completes (all-or-nothing).


### ROLLBACK

- If the app gets to a place where it can’t complete the transaction successfully, it can execute ROLLBACK
- This causes the system to “abort” the transaction
	- Database returns to a state without any of the changes made by the transaction


### ACID Properties

Atomicity: Either all changes performed by transaction occur or none occurs

Consistency: A transaction as a whole does not violate integrity constraints

Isolation: Transactions appear to execute one after the other in sequence

Durability: If a transaction commits, its changes will survive failures


### Concurrent Execution Problems

- Write-read conflict: dirty read, inconsistent read
	- A transaction reads a value written by another transaction that has not yet committed
- Read-write conflict: unrepeatable read
	- A transaction reads the value of the same object twice
	- Another transaction modifies that value in between the two reads
- Write-write conflict: lost update
	- Two transactions update the value of the same object. The second one to write the value overwrites the first change


### Schedule

Serial schedule:
- run T1 fully, then T2

Non-serial:
- interleaved operations

we want: non-serial(fast) but still correct



## Serializability

A schedule is serializable if it is equivalent to a serial schedule

The role of the scheduler is to ensure that the schedule is serializable


### Conflict Serializability

Conflicts: 
Two actions by same transaction $R_i(X); w_i(Y)$
Two writes by $T_i, T_j$ to same element $w_i(X); w_j(X)$
read/write by $T_i, T_j$ to same element $w_i(X); r_j(X)$   $r_i(X); w_j(X)$


A schedule is conflict serializable if it can be transformed into a serial schedule by a series of swappings of adjacent non-conflicting actions
- Every conflict-serializable schedule is serializable
- The converse is not true in general


#### Testing for Conflict-Serializability

Precedence graph:
- A node for each transaction $T_i$
- An edge from $T_i$ to $T_j$ whenever an action in $T_i$ conflicts with, and comes before an action in $T_j$
- No edge for actions in the same transaction
The schedule is serializable iff the precedence graph is acyclic


### View-Serializability

A schedule is view serializable if it is view equivalent to a serial schedule
- If a schedule is conflict serializable, then it is also view serializable


### Schedules with Aborted Transactions

When a transaction aborts, the recovery manager undoes its updates, but some of its updates may have affected other transactions

A schedule is recoverable if:
- It is conflict-serializable, and
- Whenever a transaction T commits, all transactions that have written elements read by T have already committed

![[recoverableschedule.png|549]]



If a transaction T aborts, then we need to abort any other transaction T’ that has read an element written by T

A schedule avoids cascading aborts if whenever a transaction reads an element, the transaction that has last written it has already committed.



## Locking

### Scheduler

- module that schedules the transaction's actions, ensuring serializability

two approaches:
- pessimistic: locks
- optimistic: timestamps, multi-version, validation

#### Pessimistic Scheduler

- each element has a unique **lock**
- each transaction must first acquire the lock before reading/writing that element
- if that lock is taken by another transaction, then wait
- the transaction must release the lock(s)



> $L_i(A)$ = transaction $T_i$ acquires lock for element $A$
> $U_i(A)$ = transaction $T_i$ releases lock for element $A$


### Two Phase Locking (2PL)

The 2PL rule:
- In every transaction, all lock requests must precede all unlock requests
- This ensures conflict serializability

#### Strict 2PL

All locks held by a transaction are released when the transaction is completed; release happens at the time of COMMIT or ROLLBACK
- Schedule is recoverable
- Schedule avoids cascading aborts

Ensures:
- Serializability
- Recoverability
- Avoids cascading aborts



## The Locking Scheduler


Task 1: act on behalf of the transaction Add lock/unlock requests to transactions
- Examine all READ(A) or WRITE(A) actions
- Add appropriate lock requests
- On COMMIT/ROLLBACK release all locks
- Ensures Strict 2PL

Task 2: act on behalf of the system, execute the locks accordingly
- Lock table: a big, critical data structure in a DBMS 
- When a lock is requested, check the lock table Grant, or add the transaction to the element’s wait list
- When lock is released reactivate transaction from its wait list
- When a transaction aborts, release all its locks
- Check for deadlocks occasionally



## Lock Types

S = shared lock (for READ)
X = exclusive lock (for WRITE)

## Lock Granularity

Fine granularity locking (e.g., tuples)
- High concurrency
- High overhead in managing locks

Coarse grain locking (e.g., tables, predicate locks)
- Many false conflicts
- Less overhead in managing locks


## 2PL Deadlocks

![[2pldeadlocks.png|598]]

Detection:
- Build wait-for graph
- Cycle = deadlock

Solution:
- Abort a transaction



## Phantom Problem


A “phantom” is a tuple that is invisible during part of a transaction execution but not invisible during the entire execution

![[phantom.png|536]]



Fixes:
- Lock entire table
- Lock index ranges
- Predicate locking (expensive)
