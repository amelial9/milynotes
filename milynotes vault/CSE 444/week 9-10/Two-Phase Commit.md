OLTP: Transactions per second
	“Online Transaction Processing



Transaction Scaling Challenges
- Distribution
- Replication


2PC Outline
- Phase 1: coordinator polls the subordinators whether they want to commit or abort
- Phase 2: coordinator notifies all subordinators of the decision commit or abort



Coordinator State Machine
- All states involve waiting for messages

Subordinate State Machine
- INIT and PREPARED involve waiting

## Handling Site Failures

What to do if there is no response
- Approach 1: no site failure detection
	- Subordinate can only do retrying & blocking
- Approach 2: timeouts, since unilateral abort is ok 
	- Subordinate: init state: can timeout; prepared state is still blocking
	- Coordinator: collecting state can timeout committing state is blocking


A subordinate fails. During recovery:
- If the last entry in the log is then the transaction is committed: REDO
- If the last entry in the log is then the transaction is aborted: UNDO
- If no COMMIT/ABORT/PREPARE is found, then presume ABORT
- If the last entry is then it’s hard: must re-contact coordinator to find out whether ABORT or COMMIT
