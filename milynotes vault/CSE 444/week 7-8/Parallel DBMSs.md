## Architecture

### Shared-Memory Architecture


![[shared memory architecture.png|357]]


- Shared main memory and disks
- Expensive to scale
- Easiest to implement on

### Shared-Disk Architecture

![[shared disk architecture.png|366]]


- Only shared disks
- No contention for memory and high availability
- Typically 1-10 machines

### Shared-Nothing Architecture

![[shared nothing architecture.png|368]]


- Uses cheap, commodity hardware
- No contention for memory and high availability
- Theoretically can scale infinitely
- Hardest to implement on



## Shared-Nothing 


Multiple DBMS instances (= processes) also called “nodes” execute on machines in a cluster
- One node plays role of the coordinator
- Other nodes play role of workers 

Workers execute queries
- Typically all workers execute the same plan
- Workers can execute multiple queries at the same time



## Data partitioning

### Option 1: Unpartitioned Table

- Entire table on just one node in the system
- Will bottleneck any query we need to run in parallel
- We choose partitioning scheme to divide rows among machines


### Option 2: Block Partitioning

![[block partitioning.png|490]]


Tuples are horizontally (row) partitioned by raw size with no ordering considered


### Option 3: Range Partitioning

Node contains tuples in chosen attribute ranges

### Option 4: Hash Partitioning

Node contains tuples with chosen attribute hashes

## Parallel selection


For a query like:

```
SELECT *
FROM R
WHERE A = 2;
```

If $R$ is block partitioned, every node scans its own chunk and applies the selection locally. The final output is the union of all local outputs.



## Parallel aggregation / Group By

For:

```
SELECT A, sum(B)
FROM R
GROUP BY A;
```

Two cases.

Case 1: $R$ is already partitioned on $A$
Each node can group locally

Case 2: $R$ is partitioned on something else 
Then rows with the same $A$ may be spread across many nodes. You need to reshuffle by $A$, so all rows for the same group end up on the same node.


Naive plan:
1. Shuffle all tuples by $A$
2. Group locally on each node

Better plan:
1. Do local partial aggregation first
2. Shuffle the smaller partial results by $A$
3. Aggregate again


## Shuffle operator


Serves to re-shuffle data between processes 
- Handles data routing, buffering, and flow control

Two parts:
ShuffleProducer and ShuffleConsumer

Producer:
- Pulls data from child operator and sends to n consumers
- Producer acts as driver for operators below it in query plan

Consumer: 
- Buffers input data from n producers and makes it available to operator through getNext() interface



## Partitioned Hash Equijoin

1. Hash shuffle tuples on join attributes
2. Local join
